                The Lykan Hypersport is a limited-production supercar manufactured by W Motors, a UAE-based company. Introduced in 2013, it is known for its aggressive styling, futuristic interior, and luxurious features. 
                What makes it stand out is its diamond-encrusted LED headlights, a holographic infotainment system, and an ultra-exotic appeal. With only seven units ever built, it remains one of the rarest supercars in history.
